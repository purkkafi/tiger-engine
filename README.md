# Tiger Engine for Godot 4

**⚠️ Work in progress! I'm currently porting over my old Godot 3 code, cleaning up everything, and finishing major features. Feel free to look around, but the engine is not in a usable state. ⚠️**

**Tiger Engine** is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)-based visual novel engine. It is:

* customizable and extensible using Godot's systems
* built for multi-language VNs & episodic release models in particular
* designed to make writing, editing, and translating prose a pleasant experience

Basic features are finished. In addition to refining the design of various parts of the engine, I'm now working on composite sprites and a Godot plugin for writing game script files.

[Documentation](https://github.com/purkkafi/tiger-engine/wiki) is in progress. The [example project](https://github.com/purkkafi/tigerengine-example-project) shows examples of how the engine's features can be used and functions as a project template.
