This is an auto-generated translation Godot project for building a translation package of [[NAME]]. Instructions:

1) Rename the folder "[[LANG]]" in "assets/lang/" to the language code of whatever language you're translating to.

2) Go through the folder, translating all text in .tef files and editing images.

3) Download Godot. (https://godotengine.org/)

4) Open this folder in Godot and export the translation package (Project -> Export, select Export PCK/Zip). You now have the finished package file, and can distribute it to your users.
